          <p>Artistic Statement</p>
    <p>The idea behind this project is to basically be a fully functional flash game essentially. Growing up, and still currently I play a plethora of games whether it was flash games or any retro game system, so if I was going to create a final work for this course I feel like pursuing a Video Game is relative to my interests. The idea transpired over a late night VRChat session I had with my close friends where we spent a lot of time playing a VRChat map called VRWare which is essentially microgames you have to complete in a certain time frame or else you fail the challenge. My chain of thought went from playing VRWare to “how can I make this in P5.js” and here we are.</p>
